Travis Invariant Builder for Nikola
===================================

Because Travis does crazy things, we prepare stuff for invariant building here.

Make sure to change the `BUILD-DATA.yml` FILE on *every* rebuild.

The built sites are available on the branches for our current Python releases.
Note that Python v2.6 is not tested for invariance.
