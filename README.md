Travis Invariant Builder for Nikola
===================================

Because Travis does crazy things, we prepare stuff for invariant building here.

Make sure to change the `BUILD-DATA` FILE on *every* rebuild!

The built site is available on the `output` branch.

Usage instructions
------------------

1. edit [BUILD-DATA in invariant-builds](https://github.com/getnikola/invariant-builds/blob/master/BUILD-DATA) (you can even do it on github)
2. wait for Travis to finish building
3. run `scripts/getbaseline.sh` in Nikolaâ€™s repo (warning: requires CWD = repo root)
